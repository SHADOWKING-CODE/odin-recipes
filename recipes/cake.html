    <h3>Origin of Cake:</h3>
    <strong><p>The origin of cake dates back to ancient times. The earliest cakes were more like bread,
               sweetened with honey, and often included nuts and dried fruits.</p>
    <p>The word "cake" comes from the Old Norse word "kaka", introduced to English 
       during Viking invasions.</p>
       <p>In medieval Europe, cakes became more distinct from bread,
         especially when cooks started using butter, eggs, and sugar.</p>
         <p>Modern cakes, as we know them—light and fluffy—emerged in the 18th century,
             especially with the invention of leavening agents
              like baking soda and baking powder.</p></strong>
