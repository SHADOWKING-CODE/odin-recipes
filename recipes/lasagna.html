   <p>Italy, likely from the region of Emilia-Romagna. The word “lasagna” comes from the</p>
   <p>Greek word laganon meaning flat sheet of pasta. Over time, it evolved into the</p>
   <p>layered dish we know today, typically made with pasta, meat sauce, bechamel or</p>
   <p>ricotta cheese, and mozzarella. It’s now enjoyed worldwide in many delicious</p>
